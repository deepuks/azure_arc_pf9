## Deploy a Platform9 Managed Kubernetes cluster and connect it to Azure Arc

The following document will guide on how to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with [Platform9 Managed Kubernetes (PMK)](https://platform9.com/managed-kubernetes/) and have it as a connected Azure Arc Kubernetes resource.
With PMK, you can have your clusters deployed on-premises, in public clouds or at the edge. In this document, we'll explain the steps on how to create an **on-premise [BareOS](https://platform9.com/docs/kubernetes/bareos-what-is-bareos) cluster** using **PMK** and connect it to **Microsoft Azure Arc**.

## Prerequisites

* An Ubuntu 20.04 installed physical machine or VM. For this demonstration, we would be using single node quick cluster installation. This machine would also act as our management host.

* The [kubectl](https://platform9.com/learn/tutorials/kubectl) exe for cluster management locally. In case you want to have a seperate host for cluster management, follow the below steps to [install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/#install-using-native-package-management) on it.

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
  sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg
  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
  ```

  > **Note:** The kubectl package is installed from Kubernetes repository, hence the Google Cloud public signing key need to be downloaded to enable the repository.
  > **All PMK cluster nodes would have these installed. If using an external host for managing the cluster, you would require to export the "kubeconfig".yaml path to KUBECONFIG variable or save it to /$HOME/.kube/config**

* [Azure CLI (az)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) version 2.15.0 and above. This cli tool would help to setup the Azure resources and connect the Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc.

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) version 3+ , to install the Azure Arc agents on the cluster.

* [Enable subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider) with the two resource providers for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.

  ```shell
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Kubernetes
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
  az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ExtendedLocation
  ```

  Registration is an asynchronous process, and registration may take approximately 10 minutes. You can monitor the registration process with the following commands

  ```shell
  az provider show -n Microsoft.Kubernetes -o table
  az provider show -n Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration -o table
  az provider show -n Microsoft.ExtendedLocation -o table
  ```

* Install the Azure Arc Kubernetes CLI extensions *connectedk8s* and *k8s-configuration* .

  ```shell
  az extension add --name connectedk8s
  az extension add --name k8s-configuration
  ```

  Run below command to verify that it is installed.

  ```shell
  az extension list -o table
  ```

* Create Azure service principal (SP)
  To be able to complete the scenario and its related automation, Azure service principal assigned with the “Contributor” role is required.

  For creating the service principal, first login to your Azure account.

  ```shell
  az login
  ```

  Login by opening the [Microsoft devicelogin page](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin) on browser and enter the code to authenticate.

  Sample output of a successful authentication would look like below;

  ![MSFT Device Login](./01.png)

  Once succeeded, create the Azure service principal (SP).

  ```shell
  az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "<service-principal-name>" --role contributor
  ```

  Below is an example of creating a service principal.

  ![Create Service Principal](./02.png)

  > *Note : It is highly recommended to scope the service principal to a specific [Azure subscription and resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest) as well considering using a [less privileged service principal account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest).*

* Create an Azure resource group where you want the PMK cluster to show up.

  ```shell
  az group create -l <Azure Region> -n <resource group name>
  ```

  Below is an example of creating a resource group.

  ![Create Resource Group](./03.png)

## Deployment

* Login to your Management Plane.

  ![PMK Management Plane Login Page](./04.png)

  > **If you do not have a registered Management Plane with Platform9, you can create one easily using [PMK Free Tier deployment](https://platform9.com/managed-kubernetes/)**

* Onboard the Ubuntu host to your Management Plane.

  For a BareOS cluster, you will need to have the nodes registered with the PMK Management Plane on which the cluster is to be deployed. For this, first add the node.

  ![Onboard a node](./05.png)

  This should take you to the Node onboarding page. A **pf9ctl** utility is provided to setup the nodes and get connected with Management Plane. Follow the instructions to download and install the utility, which we will use to prepare the node and connect it with your Platform9 Management Plane.

  ![PF9 CLI](./06.png)

  > **Note: Preparing the node and connecting it to Management Plane might take approximately 4-5 minutes to complete.**

* Create a [PMK cluster](https://platform9.com/learn/learn/get-started-bare-metal) using the onboarded node.

  The cluster creation is done from the PMK Management Plane UI. The steps for cluster creation will follow as below;

  Click to add cluster to the Management Plane.

  ![Add Cluster](./07.png)

  Create a cluster from the nodes onboarded to the Management Plane.

  ![Create One Click Cluster](./08.png)

  Enter the cluster name, version and the node (in this demo we have only one node) and Complete the page.

  ![Cluster name entry](./09.png)

  The cluster is created in a few minutes and the status should be reported as "Healthy".

  ![Cluster Created](./10.png)

* Once cluster is Ready, set the environment variables according to your Azure service principal name and Azure environment on the host.

  ![Export values](./11.png)

  > *The values can referenced from the service principal and resource groups outputs.*

* Login to your Azure subscription using the Service Principal created.

  ```shell
  az login --service-principal --username $appId --password $password --tenant $tenantId
  ```

  An example output is shown below;

  ![Azure subscription login](./12.png)

* Connect the Platform9 Managed Kubernetes (PMK) cluster to Azure Arc.

  ```shell
  az connectedk8s connect --name $arcClusterName --resource-group $resourceGroup
  ```

  > **Note : The KUBECONFIG needs to be set before running this command. The kubeconfig file for the cluster can be downloaded from the Management Plane**

  ![Download Kubeconfig](./13.png)

  An example output is shown below;

  ![Export KUBECONFIG](./14.png)

  ![Connect to Azure Arc](./15.png)



## Verification

* The cluster should be seen onboarded as a new Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes resource.

  ![Cluster Verification](./16.png)

* Azure Arc agents are running in the cluster.

  ![List pods azure-arc](./17.png)

## Deleting the Deployment

* The Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes resource can be deleted via the Azure Portal.

  ![Azure Arc cluster deletion](./18.png)

* For deleting the entire environment, just delete the Azure resource group that was created.
